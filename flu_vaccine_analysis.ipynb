    "This project explores the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS), which was a phone survey that asked respondents if they received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, as well as additional questions about their socioeconomic, demographic background, and opinions on illness risks and vaccine effectiveness. For the purpose of this project, the Public Health Institute would like to better understand the prediction of how likely individuals are to receive their seasonal flu vaccines. Especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, they would like to focus their efforts on outreach to communities that would benefit from more vaccine information/resources. \n",

The Public Health Institute should be able to use this understanding to minimize the amount of people that could've benefited from vaccine outreach and see what factors might contribute the most to individuals choosing not to receive the vaccine. By knowing this, the Public Health Institute can focus their efforts on specific communities and aid in providing the necessary resources to increase vaccine rates and in return, better understand vaccine effectiveness. \n",

The features set contains the different survey questions while the labels set contains the target variables, which are whether the respondents received the vaccines. Each row in the dataset represents one person and is identified by a respondent ID. For all binary variables, 0 = No and 1 = Yes. The dataset contains 26,707 entries. For this analysis, only the seasonal flu label will be used. In addition, specific H1N1 survey features will not be used."

Although there is probably some correlation between the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine, this analysis will focus on seasonal flu and will discuss implications of using the H1N1 data later on. Missing values will be explored and any additional cleaning needed during data exploration."
